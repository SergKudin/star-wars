# SWAPI API Documentation

## Project Description
SWAPI Project is a RESTful API that provides access to "Star Wars" movie data. The main goal of the project is to learn how to implement similar functionality using tools like Nest, Swagger, TypeORM, and others to create a backend for an informational website about the "Star Wars" universe. The website's interface reflects the author's vision of implementing such functionality.

## Swagger Documentation
Detailed API documentation can be found on the Swagger page (available after project launch): [http://localhost:3000/api#/](http://localhost:3000/api#/)

## Endpoint Overview

### People
- `GET /people/page/{page}` - Returns a page of People objects with a page size of PAGE_LIMIT. Default PAGE_LIMIT = 10. Here, `{page}` refers to the page number.
- `GET /people/{id}` - Returns a People object with the specified ID. Here, `{id}` refers to the relevant object's ID.
- `GET /people/list-removed` - Returns a list of removed objects available for restoration. For editors and administrators.

  data?: T,
  error?: string,
  message?: string[],
}

interface SwapiResponse<T extends People | Planet | Films | Species | Vehicles | Starships | Photo>  {
  count: number,
  next: string,
  previous: string,

    "_id": 1,
    "name": "Luke Skywalker",
    ...
  }
}
```

### Request with Error (e.g., non-existent id):
```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:3000/people/110' \

```

### Request with Message Response:
```bash

## Getting Started Recommendations

To begin working with the project, follow these steps:

1. Start the database and ensure access with the settings provided in the constants:
   - DATABASE_HOST
   - DATABASE_PORT
   - DATABASE_USER
   - DATABASE_PASS
   - DATABASE_NAME

2. Since the database is empty, use the following command to create tables from the terminal:
   ```bash
   npm run migration:run
   ```

3. Compile and start the project, for example:
   - Using Docker:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```
   - On the host machine:
     ```bash
     npm run start:dev
     ```
   **Note:** Make sure that the ports used by the project are available at the time of launch.

4. Access the Swagger documentation page at [http://localhost:3000/api#/](http://localhost:3000/api#/).

5. Execute the following request to populate the database with information:
   ```bash
   curl -X 'POST' \
     'http://localhost:3000/migration/createAll' \
     -H 'accept: */*' \
     -d ''
   ```

6. Continue exploring the API's functionality on the documentation page.
